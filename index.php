        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="tag">First and foremost, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant loss of human life worldwide, and it poses an unprecedented threat to public health, food systems, and the workplace. Tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty as a result of the pandemic's economic and social devastation. Furthermore, COVID-19 had a negative influence on the economy in every way, starting with the workforce and corporate shares, etc...Hundreds of millions of businesses are in danger of going out of business. Nearly half of the world's 3.3 billion workers are at risk of losing their jobs. Workers in the informal economy are especially vulnerable because they lack social security and access to adequate health care, as well as having lost access to productive assets. Many people are unable to feed themselves and their families during lock-downs since they do not have the means to make money. For the majority, no money means no food, or at the very least, less food that is less nutritious. On the other side, it had positive effects on many areas of nature, such as air quality and the greenhouse effect. During the lockdown, air pollution concentrations were found to be lower in every city around the world. PM2.5 and PM10 have also been identified as the most impacting air concentrators that govern the air quality of all the selected locations during and after lock-down; however, the lock-down affects the different factories and the automobile industry, which had a great influence on the percentage of the air pollutants. The air quality has changed mainly for the better as the percentage of pollutants in the air decreases according to  Air Quality Index (AQI). Furthermore, the EO Dashboard analysis indicates that air quality increases with the installation of lock-down (during the COVID epidemic), which immediately improves human health conditions. To conclude, COVID-19 had a negative influence on many aspects; however, It also had some good ones.</p>
